## Setup ZSH alialas

```bash

cd ~
mkdir -p ~/code/p
cd ~/code/p
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTowles/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

```

## Link a few files from the repo to home directory

```bash
# make symbolic link for .zshrc
cd ~/
mv .zshrc .zshrc.old
ln -s $HOME/code/p/dotfiles/.zshrc $HOME/.zshrc

```

## local only scripts

```bash
# create a per machine only file, Also I also use this to load additional scripts from a private repo.
touch $HOME/.zshrc_local

# switch back to previous .zshrc file
rm ~/.zshrc
mv ~/.zshrc.old ~/.zshrc

```

```

## History

So I have a private repo I've been using to backup my `.zshrc` and other common scripts but recently when rebuilding my home computer I thought I copy [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) and his [dotfiles](https://github.com/antfu/dotfiles) repo and made mine public.
