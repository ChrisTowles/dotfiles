## Terminal

Using built in terminal. this is important because you can't change vscode on linux to use a different app.

Change keybindings so `ctrl` + `c` is copy.
Change keybindings so `ctrl` + `v` is paste.

This means `ctrl` + `shift` + `c` is the kill command.


Setup zsh.

Change the terminal copy and paste commands.

This means `ctrl` + `c` is copy and `ctrl` + `v` is paste. But if command is running then `ctrl` + `c` will still kill command.

```json

{
        "key": "ctrl+c",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.copySelection",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalHasBeenCreated && terminalTextSelected || terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported && terminalTextSelected"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+c",
        "command": "-workbench.action.terminal.copySelection",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalHasBeenCreated && terminalTextSelected || terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported && terminalTextSelected"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+v",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.paste",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalHasBeenCreated || terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+v",
        "command": "-workbench.action.terminal.paste",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalHasBeenCreated || terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
